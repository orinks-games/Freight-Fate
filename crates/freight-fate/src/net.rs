//! Port of `freight_fate/net.py` — shared HTTPS helpers: one verified TLS

//! Frozen Python builds could ship an OpenSSL whose CA paths were baked in on

//! platform store. The Rust build talks TLS through rustls with the platform
//! verifier: the operating system's own roots (corporate proxy roots on
//! Windows included) on every platform, with no bundle to go stale.
//!
//! This module also owns the two things every online module used to reach
//! for separately in Python: the [`Transport`] trait (the `_http_json`
//! callable the services and their tests inject) and the [`NetError`] taxonomy
//! that stands in for `urllib.error.HTTPError` / `URLError` / `ssl` /
//! `socket` exceptions, so [`describe_error`] can speak the same sentences.

// -- who may reach the real network ------------------------------------------------
//
// Every byte this process sends anywhere -- orinks.net presence, activation,
// the journal outbox, cloud saves, the GitHub update check, and the live
// weather, traffic and parking feeds -- leaves through `request` below. It is
// the one door, so it is where the capability lives, exactly as
// `browser::open_url` is the one door to a web browser.
//
// # Why the default is "refuse"
//
// The seam used to be per service: a test injected a `Transport` and the
// service used it. That is fail OPEN in two ways at once.
//
// * `App::new_headless` builds `OnlinePresence`, `CloudSaves` and both
//   `JournalOutbox`es with `..Default::default()`, which is the LIVE
//   transport on background threads. Nothing an `install_transport` guard
//   does reaches them -- they carry their own. The only thing keeping a test
//   suite's heartbeats off orinks.net was that a pinned data directory yields
//   no driver identity; a test that adopted one and turned presence on would
//   have posted to the live site as the owner.
// * The live-data feeds have no injectable seam at the drive at all: a drive
//   with real weather on builds `RealWeatherProvider::with_nws(UreqTransport)`
//   and requests every city on the route before a test can swap in a fake.
//   Several cases do exactly that, and on 2026-08-24 the suite was measured
//   asking api.weather.gov about Chicago, Gary and Indianapolis from
//   `weather-city` and `weather-route` worker threads -- so what a drive was
//   carrying depended on whether the machine had a network and on what the
//   sky over Chicago was doing.
//
// So the capability is explicit and process-wide:
//
// * [`allow_real_network`] is called once, by `main()`, and only by `main()`.
//   A test binary has no `main()` of the game's, so no test process can ever
//   be granted it -- nothing to remember and nothing to forget.
// * Until it is called, [`request`] records the address in
//   [`refused_requests`] and panics. No socket is opened.
// * It is an `AtomicBool` rather than a thread-local on purpose. Every one of
//   these callers runs on a background worker -- presence, the outboxes,
//   cloud saves, `weather-<city>` -- and a per-thread guard is invisible to a
//   thread the test did not spawn. That is precisely the escape route
//   discipline cannot close.
//
// The panic is deliberate. A quiet error return reads to every caller here as
// "the network is down", which is a state the game handles gracefully and
// nobody would ever look at -- and for the weather provider it reads as
// literally `unavailable()`. On a worker thread the panic is not seen by the
// test runner, which is what [`refused_requests`] is for: the attempt is on
// the record whether or not anything was watching.
